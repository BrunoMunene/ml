 Introduction

Football match predictions rely on analyzing team performance, odds, and historical data. This project uses a neural network implemented in TensorFlow to predict match outcomes (win/loss/draw). It includes data preprocessing techniques such as handling missing values, label encoding, and scaling numerical features. 

Key goals:
- Build an efficient and customizable model.
- Use historical data and betting odds for predictions.
- Evaluate and visualize model performance.

 Project Workflow

1. Data Preparation:
   - Load data from CSV files or other sources.
   - Handle missing values using forward fill techniques.
   - Encode categorical data (e.g., team names).
2. Feature Engineering:
   - Extract relevant features like betting odds.
   - Scale numerical data for model input.
3. Model Training:
   - Use a dense neural network with ReLU activations and dropout for regularization.
   - Train using binary cross-entropy for binary classification tasks.
4. Evaluation:
   - Measure accuracy and loss on the test dataset.
   - Visualize training and validation performance.
5. Prediction:
   - Generate probabilistic predictions for unseen data.
